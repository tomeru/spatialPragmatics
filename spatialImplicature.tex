How do people understand the pragmatics of spatial language? 
We propose a rational-speech act model for spatial reasoning, and apply it to the terms `in' and `near'. We examine people's fine-grain spatial reasoning in this domain by having them locate where an event occurred, given an utterance. Our pragmatic listener model provides a quantitative and qualitative fit to people's inferneces. \textbf{Keywords:}

\section{Introduction} 
%Space is continuous and spatial relations between objects can be complex;
Space is continuous, language is discrete, and spatial language is coarse and limited---built from a restricted and closed class of spatial prepositions \cite{talmy83,talmy00,landau93} such as ``in,'' ``on,'' and ``near.'' 
How can we communicate accurately about spatial relations with an impoverished, discrete spatial vocabulary?
%The spatial world is rich and complex, but our spatial vocabulary is often coarse and limited. 
%English---like many other languages---has a restricted and closed class of spatial prepositions~\cite{talmy83,talmy00,landau93} such as ``in,'' ``on,'' and ``near.'' 
%that describe a potentially infinite set of spatial relations. This raises a natural question: How do we make accurate inference in spatial situations when our spatial vocabulary is somewhat impoverished?
A partial solution lies in the pragmatics of spatial language.
Pragmatic enrichment allows coarse fixed meanings to gain useful context-specific refinements \cite{grice75,horn84}.
This is especially useful when the conveyed states are much finer-grained than the literal vocabulary. Moreover, the spatial domain provides a useful test of pragmatic theory: there is a great deal of room for enrichment in a fine-grained domain.

%plausible solution to this question is via pragmatics~\cite{grice75,horn84}. On this view, listener would make inferences that go beyond the literal meaning of speaker's utterance by taking speaker's perspective in a given context. After all, inference is cheap and articulation is expensive~\cite{levinson00}, and therefore we expect pragmatics to play a key role in enriching the core spatial vocabulary that can be limited under many different situations. 
%
%\ndg{tighten first par a bit: the challenge of combinatorial langauge to describe continuous space. pragmatics as a partial solution.}

To illustrate the potential pragmatics of spatial language, consider the top half of Figure~\ref{fig:illustration}: this is a map of a small city with two quarters (represented by the red and blue rectangles) and a plaza that is located inside one of the quarters (represented by the dashed circle). 
Suppose you were told that ``a gold lily grew in the red quarter.'' Where would you think the flower had grown? 
Taking ``in'' at face value (i.e.~the literal meaning) would mean uniform uncertainty over the red region.  
But a pragmatic listener could arrive at a more specific interpretation: The speaker did not say the lily was in the plaza, nor near the plaza, nor on the edge of the red quarter.... From this a listener could infer that the lily was probably in none of these locations, and derive a much more specific guess as to where the lily was.
In many ways this is a standard scalar implicature \cite{horn84}, such as ``some'' implying ``not all,'' but the interpretation space is much richer and the effect of context is easily manipulated---if the plaza were not inside the red quarter, or placed differently inside it, a pragmatic listener's interpretation should change.


Because of the fine-grained space of interpretations, spatial language provides a particularly good domain to explore quantitative models of natural language pragmatics, such as the recently successful Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework \cite{frank2012predicting,ndg+ast:topics2013}.
Previous empirical work has discussed the role of pragmatics in spatial locative expressions~\cite{herskovits85,herskovits87}. 
However, formal work in this domain is scarce and recent computational studies have emphasized production over comprehension \cite{carstensen14,golland10}.
Thus, no studies have looked at the quantitative effects of implicature in the spatial domain.
% speaker's role in the pragmatic use of spatial language~\cite{carstensen14,golland10}, but not how listener makes pragmatic inference based on implicatures. 
 We aim to bridge this gap with a formal RSA-based model, that quantitatively predicts how a listener interprets spatial language in a 2D map domain. 

%There are two possiblilities. In the first case, a listener who takes the literal meaning of ``in'' would infer the lily to have grown anywhere within the red square. This follows from the fact that the core meaning of ``in'' would simply refer to locations within the enclosure of the red rectangle as bounded by its sides. However, a more sophisticated listener might instead reason as follows for a more precise spatial inference: ``If the lily had grown in the plaza, the speaker would have said that the lily grew in the plaza. However, given that she didn't say so, the lily must have grown within the red quarter but in areas excluding that plaza.'' Thus, this pragmatic listener would be able to make a more specific prediction than the literal listener about where the lily might have grown, even though the speaker's utterance is identical in both cases. In this respect, pragmatic reasoning helps the listener to locate things beyond the precision of what the meaning of ``in'' conventionally renders by combining perspective taking (i.e. playing the role of speaker) with one's knowledge of the spatial situation (i.e. the fact that the plaza is located inside the red square).

\section{Modeling spatial implicature}\label{mod}

We model spatial language understanding within the Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework of \citeA{frank2012predicting}. This framework has previously been applied to domains such as object properties, with terms such as quantifiers (e.g.~``some of the apples are red'' implying that only a subset of the apples are red). We adapt this framework to spatial language by taking locations as the domain of interest, and building a lexicon for describing spatial relations. 

The RSA framework specifies a pragmatic listener reasoning about the intention of an informative speaker, who in turn reasons about a literal listener; the literal listener updates her beliefs by conditioning on the truth of an utterance.
Altogether, writing the location of interest (e.g.~of the gold lily) as $s$ and the utterance (e.g.``in the red quarter'') as $u$:
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{L_0}(s|u)&\propto& \delta_{\denote{u}(s)} P(s)\label{eqn:L0}\\
P_{S_1}(u|s)&\propto&\sum_{s' \text{ s.t. } |s-s'|<\epsilon} P_{L_0}(s'|u) P(u)\label{eqn:S1}\\
P_{L_1}(s|u)&\propto&P_{S_1}(u | s) P(s) \label{eqn:L1}
\end{eqnarray}
Beginning with the simplest listener model, $L_0$, Equation \ref{eqn:L0} specifies a listener who interprets the utterance via its truth-functional denotation $\denote{u}$ (described in more detail below), and simply restricts the prior distribution over locations to those where this denotation is true.
The speaker, $S_1$, in Equation \ref{eqn:S1} aims for the literal listener to guess the correct location, balanced against the prior probability of the utterance. However, because it is vanishingly unlikely for $L_0$ to guess exactly the right location, our speaker only cares if the true and gusseded locations are within a small distance $\epsilon$; this corresponds to an \emph{approximate question under discussion} as used by \citeA{kao2014}.
Finally, the pragmatic listener, $L_1$, in Equation \ref{eqn:L1} updates her beliefs in accord with Bayes' rule, under the assumption that the $S_1$ speaker would have chosen the utterance she heard.


%spatial implicature using the rational speaker-listener model applied previously to domains such as scalar implicature and social reasoning \cite{ndg+ast:topics2013,ast+ndg:cogsys2013}. We consider a speaker and listener as in the sketch shown in Figure (**). Both speaker and listener have access to a shared lexicon that contains a mapping from possible utterances to predicates that return Boolean values over states of the world. For example, in our specific lexicon the utterance ``in Red Quarter'' maps to a predicate that takes in a location  and returns the value $True$ if that location falls within the boundaries of the Red Quarter rectangle, and $False$ otherwise. We expand on the lexicon details further down. 
%
%The listener attempts to infer the true state of where an event occurred in the world ($s$), by considering the utterance they heard from the speaker ($u$), and the listener's knowledge of the world and the speaker. We consider two possible listeners. The first is a \textit{literal} listener ($L_0$) who understands an utterance by strictly referring to its meaning in a lexicon, modulated by the prior probability of a state occurring:
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{L_0}(s|u)\propto P(s|u(s)=True)P(u),
%\end{equation}
%
%A speaker faced with such a literal listener ($S_0$) will choose an utterance that will maximize the probability of the listener inferring the correct state $s$. In continuous spatial distributions an exact equality between the observed state $s$ and the listener's inferred state $s'$ cannot be expected, and it is only required that an approximate equality condition holds $s\approx s'$. In this paper we use $|s-s'|<\epsilon$, though other approximate equality conditions are possible. The speaker is then:
%
%(*** Not sure about the exact equation to put down here ***)
%\begin{equation}
%P_{S_0}(u|s)\propto ***
%\end{equation}
%
%The second possible listener is a \textit{pragmatic} listener ($L_1$), who takes into account the speaker's reasoning when choosing an utterance:
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{L_1}(s|u)\propto P_{S_0}(u|s)P(s)
%\end{equation}
%
%Such recursive, probabilistic reasoning can be captured as a probabilistic program. We implemented the model in the Church language (cite, website?) along the following lines: \\
%
%\texttt{({\color{blue}{define}} (speaker state)}\\
%\texttt{\tab ({\color{blue}{rejection-query}}}\\
%\texttt{\tab  ({\color{blue}{define}} utterance (sample utterance-prior))}\\
%\texttt{\tab   \color{BurntOrange};; Return utterance...}\\
%\texttt{\tab   utterance}\\
%\texttt{\tab   \color{BurntOrange};; Conditioned on...}\\
%\texttt{\tab  (about-equal state (listener utterance 0))))}\\
%\texttt{}\\
%\texttt{({\color{blue}{define}} (listener utterance depth)}\\
%\texttt{\tab ({\color{blue}{rejection-query}}}\\
%\texttt{\tab  (define state (sample state-prior))}\\
%\texttt{\tab   \color{BurntOrange};; Return state...}\\
%\texttt{\tab  state}\\
%\texttt{\tab   \color{BurntOrange};; Conditioned on...}\\
%\texttt{\tab  ({\color{blue}{if}} (= depth 0)}\\
%\texttt{\tab \tab \tab  (utterance state)}\\
%\texttt{\tab \tab \tab  (equal? utterance (speaker state))))}\\
%
%Listeners of depth 0 and 1 are \textit{literal} listener $L_0$ and \textit{pragmatic} listener $L_1$ as defined above. While higher combinations of listener and speaker depths are useful in games of social coordination (CITE), in many tasks the \textit{pragmatic} listener model is sufficient, and here we are interesting is seeing how well it models people's behavior in a spatial task above that of a \textit{literal} listener. 

%\subsubsection{Lexicon} 


The denotation of an utterance $u$ is a function from location to Boolean: $\denote{u}(s)\in \text{Bool}$.
We will assume that the spatial language relevant to our scenarios depends on a context set of regions in $\mathbb{R}^2$, as in Figure \ref{fig:illustration}: The City, The Red Quarter, The Blue Quarter, The Victory Plaza.\footnote{Both the denotation and Equations \ref{eqn:L0}--\ref{eqn:L1} depend on the context of named regions. We leave this dependence implicit to avoid clutter.}
%The utterances are implemented as boolean functions that take in a state of the world (the x,y pair where an event occurred) and return $True$ or $False$. 
We considered three types of spatial utterances, each of which combines a preposition with a region name: 
\begin{itemize}
\item ``In'' utterances (e.g. ``In the Red Quarter'') are true within the region: $\denote{\text{``in R''}}(s) := s\in R$.
\item ``Near edge'' utterances (e.g. ``Near the edge of the Red Quarter'') are true within distance $d$ of a region boundary: $\denote{\text{``near edge R''}}(s) := \mu(s,\beta(R))<d$. (Where $\mu$ measures distance to a set, and $\beta$ returns the boundary of a region.)
\item ``Near'' utterances (e.g. ``Near the Red Quarter'') are true near the edge but not inside: $\denote{\text{``near R''}}(s) := 
\denote{\text{``near edge R''}}(s) \wedge \neg \denote{\text{``in R''}}(s)$.
\end{itemize}
People no doubt have access to many more spatial utterances, and their combinations; we restrict ourselves to this set for simplicity. We set a uniform prior over the utterances, $P(u)$, and location, $P(s)$. 


% return $True$ if the event falls within the boundaries of a region and $False$ otherwise. ``Near-edge'' utterances (e.g. ``Near the edge of the Red Quarter'') return $True$ if the event is within a distance $d$ of the boundaries of a region and $False$ otherwise. ``Near'' utterances (e.g. ``Near the Red Quarter'') return $True$ if the event is near the edge of a region but not in it, as defined by the ``In'' and ``Near-edge'' utterances. 



%\subsubsection{Parameter choice} 

The model as stated leaves open the question of what distance counts as ``Near'' or ``Near edge'' in the shared lexicon (what $d$ to use), as well as what counts as ``approximately equal'' between the true state and the inferred state (what $\epsilon$ to use). We set $\epsilon$ to 20 units (pixels) based on initial exploration. Because the intuitive flexibility of ``Near'' seems to depend on the item and context (``near your coffee mug'' is not the same as ``near your coffee house''), we allow the literal listener to establish the most useful $d$ for each utterance.
We extend Equation \ref{eqn:L0} to include uncertainty about the tolerances for each ``near'' utterance:
\begin{equation}
P_{L_0}(s|u)\propto \sum_{\vec{d}} \delta_{\denote{u}^{\vec{d}}(s)} P(s) P(\vec{d})\label{eqn:L0tol},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{d}$ is a real number, the tolerance. We assume $P(\vec{d})$ is uniform over 10-30 units (pixels) for each utterance\footnote{For comparison, the maps used are $500x300$ units (pixels).}. 

We implement this model in the probabilistic programming language Church \cite{goodman2012church}. A full implementation can be found at \url{http://forestdb.org/models/spatialImplicature.html}. We used this implementation to generate model predictions for each spatial configuration (``city map'') and utterance used in the experiment below.

\section{Experiment}\label{sec:exps}

We examined people's spatial inferences and the predictions of our model for the spatial terms `in' and `near', by putting participants in the role of a listener and asking them to guess where an event happened on a map. Participants made their guess in response to the utterance of a speaker with access to the location of the event. 

\subsection{Participants, materials and methods}

Participants ($N=49$, 13 female, median age 29) were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk service. 

We created 4 city maps like the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:illustration}, each containing 2 ``Quarters'' of different size and color, and a circle labeled ``Victory Plaza''. The location of the Plaza varied between the cities, while the location of the Quarters remained the same. To broadly control for color and position, we created another set of 4 maps by flipping the original maps along the vertical and horizontal axis, and changing the color of the quarters, making 8 maps in total. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two map groups. 

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/results1.pdf}
\caption{Examples highlighting trends from Figures \ref{fig:In} and \ref{fig:Near}. The response to the same utterance (column) changes by the different relative configuration of the regions.}
\label{fig:zoomIn}
\end{figure*}

Participants were told that they would see a series of city maps, that a special flower called a `Gold Lily' can grow anywhere in the city they're shown, and that their task is to find the Gold Lilies. 

Participants were further told that for each map a person will tell them where a Gold Lily grew, and that this person can say the Gold Lily grew \textit{in} a location or \textit{near} a location. This person was said to be reasonable, and honest. As an example, a participant might read the sentence `A person tells you: A Gold Lily grew in the Red Quarter'. Participants made their guess by clicking directly on the maps they were shown.

For each of the 4 maps in their group, participants were prompted with a sentence made of $word \times location$ combinations, where $word \in [In,\ Near]$ and $location \in [Red\ Quarter,\ Blue\ Quarter,\ Victory\ Plaza,\ City]$. The combination ``Near the City'' was not used, as this area was not in the scope of the image and likely to create confusion. In total, each participant was prompted with 28 sentences in random order. Each map had a legend to its right. 

\subsection{Qualitative Results} 

Figures \ref{fig:In} and \ref{fig:Near} show responses for ``in'' and ``near''sentences, collapsing across the rotated-and-inverted-color cities and color-coded by the region referred to. For example, in the top-left of Figure \ref{fig:In}, the blue dots correspond to all participant guesses for where the flower grew in City 1, when prompted with ``In the Blue Quarter''. 

To highlight qualitative effects, we focus on the cases highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:zoomIn}. The reader is encouraged to examine the remaining twenty cases, which show similar effects. 

\textbf{`In X' implies `In X but not in Y'} As shown for example in Figure \ref{fig:zoomIn}(a): Both the top and bottom of (a) show guesses for lily location when told it grew in the Blue Quarter. When people hear `In Blue' in City 1 (top) they infer `In center of Blue'. But in City 2 (bottom) they infer `In Blue, but not in the Plaza'. More specifically, in City 1 (top) a tic-tac-toe-like division of the Quarter shows that the grid center, accounting for 11\% of the area, captures 59\% of the guesses. And in City 2 (bottom) the same grid center contains just 8\% of the guesses, as people shift guesses to the right of the Plaza. Such a pattern of results holds for the other regions as well, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:In}. 

\textbf{Edge avoidance} When there is no direct intersection between regions (except the City, which all regions intersect with), people do not guess uniformly in the region, but rather favor the center. For example, in Figure \ref{fig:zoomIn}(b), bottom: People told `In Red' place most of their guesses in the center of the region. A tic-tac-toe grid-analysis shows the red-grid center accounts for 11\% of the area but 65\% of the guesses. In 10,000 simulations of 49 participants that guess uniformly over the Red Quarter,  \textit{none} have the center account for more than $\sim$30\% of the responses. This pattern of results holds for the other regions as well, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:In}, though it is disrupted when the Plaza is placed inside the region as in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:zoomIn}(b). 

\begin{figure}[!b]
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/nearByQuad.png}
\caption{Distribution of participant `Near' guesses, by region (color-coded) and city.}
\label{fig:nearByQuad}
\end{figure}

\textbf{`Near' is non-uniform on edges} As shown in Figure \ref{fig:zoomIn}(c) and (d), when told `Near Plaza' or `Near Blue' people do not seem to be guessing uniformly, rather their guesses depend on the context of other regions. In the top panel of (c) people place their guesses for `Near Plaza' to the top-left of the Plaza, while in the bottom panel of (c) people place their guesses for `Near Plaza' to the top and right of the plaza. In the top panel of (d) the guesses for `Near Blue' are to the left and bottom of the Blue Quarter, while in bottom of (d) they shift away from the left of the Blue Quarter (now partly occupied by the Plaza). Figure \ref{fig:nearByQuad} shows the percentage of participant guesses by quadrant, indicating the by region under consideration. A $\chi^2$ test on binned responses near each region (as in Figure \ref{fig:nearByQuad}) shows 11 of the 12 response-patterns are significantly different from uniform ($p<0.05$), with the Blue Quarter in City 3 being the only exception. 
% (top-left quadrant of figure with respect to Plaza accounts for 51\% of the guesses, top-right 4\%, bottom-right 18\%, bottom-left 16\%. Remaining 11\% are in the Plaza). However, in City 1 (bottom panel of (c)) people places their guesses for `Near Plaza' to the top and to the right of the plaza (top-left quadrant 22\% of the guesses, top-right 41\%, bottom-right 20\%, bottom-left 2\%. Remaining 15\% are in the Plaza). %As for the Blue Quarter, 
% In City 3 (top panel of (d)) people place their guesses for `Near Blue' to the left and bottom of the Blue Quarter (top-left quadrant of figure with respect to Blue Quarter accounts for X\% of the guesses, top-right X\%, bottom-right X\%, bottom-left X\%. Remaining X\% are in the Quarter). However, in City 4 (bottom panel of (d)) people places their guesses for `Near Blue' to the top and to the right of the Blue Quarter (top-left quadrant X\% of the guesses, top-right X\%, bottom-right X\%, bottom-left X\%. Remaining X\% are in the Quarter).

\label{fig:modelExamples}
\end{figure*}

This qualitative pattern of results make it clear that context affects participants' interpretations of spatial language, as expected under a pragmatic account. In the next section, we turn to a quantitative analysis, comparing results with the different listener models described above. 

\section{Comparison to Model(s)}

In order to quantitatively compare people to the literal and pragmatic listener models ($L_0$ and $L_1$), we converted participants' responses for each condition into smooth two-dimensional distributions. We used non-parametric, multivariate kernel density estimation to infer these distributions \cite{epanechnikov1969non}. The same estimation was applied to samples drawn from the probabilistic programs that represent the $L_0$ and $L_1$ models. The model distributions are `sharpened' by raising them to a power $\alpha$ and renormalizing. Such a sharpening parameter controls how much of the model's distribution is centered around the maximum likelihood, and is functionally similar to an `optimality' parameter used in other implicature studies \cite{ndg+ast:topics2013,kao2014}. We set $\alpha=1.5$, although the overall findings are robust within an explored range $\alpha \in [1,2]$. 

Example comparisons between the models and people are shown in Figure \ref{fig:modelExamples}. When hearing `In Red' in City 1 (left-most column) The literal listener $L_0$ places a uniform posterior distribution on the Red Quarter, while $L_1$ and people avoid Victory Plaza and lean to the right of the Red Quarter. This correspondence can be measured in terms of the Kullback–-Leibler ($KL$) distance between the distributions. In this particular example, $KL(\text{people} | L_0) = 0.43$, while $KL(\text{people} | L_1) = 0.25$. 

As Figure \ref{fig:modelExamples} shows, the $L_1$ model captures many of the interesting spatial-implicature interpretations shown by people.
Indeed, the $L_1$ listener shows the same general qualitative patterns discussed in the previous section (``in X'' implies ``in X but not Y'', edge avoidance, non-uniformity on edges). A full comparison figure exceeds the space limits of this paper, but can be found at \url{http://www.mit.edu/~tomeru/spatialPragmatics/allComparisons.pdf}. Figure \ref{fig:KL} shows the $KL$ distances for both models across all questions and cities. The pragmatic listener is closer to people than the literal listener for 26 of the 28 (93\%) comparisons. 

While the pragmatic listener is able to account for the pattern of results found with people, it is interesting to highlight some particular cases where it does not do so well. The left column of Figure \ref{fig:modelProbs} shows one of the two cases where the $KL$ distance between people and the literal listener is shorter than between people and the pragmatic listener.  While the implicature pattern of the pragmatic listener seems generally correct -- it places its probability in the Red Quarter while avoiding the Plaza -- the model is over-avoiding the area near the plaza relative to people. The right column of Figure \ref{fig:modelProbs} shows an example where even though the pragmatic listener is closer to people than the literal listener, it seems generally mistaken in that it places much of its probability distribution within the Red Quarter, which people avoid.

\caption{Mismatches between pragmatic listener and people, with literal listener for comparison. Details similar to Fig. \ref{fig:modelExamples}.}

\end{figure}

Overall, the results suggest that the pragmatic listener model can account for the quantitative and qualitative pattern of pragmatic spatial inferences of people, within our domain.  

\section{Discussion}



Space is fine grained, more so than language, leaving a great deal of room for the influence of context and pragmatic enrichment. As a result, spatial language is a promising avenue for testing quantitative models of pragmatic reasoning. We investigated people's fine-grained pragmatic reasoning in a spatial domain, and found support for a model within the rational speech act (RSA) framework.  

The model's lexicon was more restricted than natural spatial language. Even within our domain, utterances might include `in the middle of the City', `in between the Red and Blue Quarters', `above Victory Plaza', `to the left of the Blue Quarter, near the Plaza'.... In future work, a parallel production task (in which people convey a map location using language) should be used to inform and expand the lexicon. 

Many other simple extensions of this paradigm suggest themselves. For instance, when reasoning pragmatically, people take into account the knowledge of their partner \cite{ndg+ast:topics2013}. Within a spatial context, a speaker might adjust the landmarks and utterances they use depending on the listener: `it is next to Jacques' caf\'{e}' for those in the know vs.~`it is next to the Louvre' for out-of-towners. The listener could correspondingly adjust their inferences depending on what they believe the speaker knows.

Within the model, one of the most important directions for exploration is the treatment of \emph{pragmatic slack} in expressions like ``near Victory Plaza.'' We modeled the tolerance of the lexical items as uncertain, allowing the literal listener to infer an appropriate value. Such a literal-slack model allows the slack to adjust in order to increase the probability of a speaker's utterance being true; it neglects other pressures that may be important, such as making the speaker's utterance \emph{informative}. 
%\ndg{for instance?}
One possibility is to \emph{lift} the slack variable into the pragmatic listener (as in \citeNP{goodman2014probabilistic}). While this model is straightforward to construct, future work is needed to find cases which distinguish it from the model used here.
